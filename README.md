# Background
Created as a self-directed project in January 2025. Meant to exercise some basic computer architecture concepts while simultaneously giving me some practive with SystemVerilog and UVM, ultimately will try to synthesize on FPGA following verification in simulation.

# High Level Description
Two-level cache hierarchy featuring a 4096 KB L1 cache and ____ KB L2 cache. The first cache features a CPU and lower level (LL) memory interface, with write back to the L2 cache. The L2 cache interfaces with the upper level (UL) cache, as well as main memory.
